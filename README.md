## Cocktail mixer app

Cocktail mixer React app that fetches API (Axios) allowing users to search for their favourite coktails recipes. It displays details of each cocktail such as: whether it contains alcohol or not, what glass to use, all necessary ingredients and a method of preparation. This app was created as a response to my personal interest in mixology and perfect way of improving my React skills in a real-life project. I used React functional components along with hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext), axios to fetch API, SCSS preprocessor for styling and GSAP library for animation.
